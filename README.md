## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
-is the method of a software development that uses software components called services to create business applications.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
> Reausability - rather than copying and pasting from one workflow to another, you can make workflows reusable.

> Composability - as it accelerates organization transformation towards a cloud native future.

> Maturing through time - as the internet is still growing then the goals and the growth of SOA is making it step for getting the expectation of everyone.

3. Define Microservices.
-an architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
> Improves productivity - Microservices allows the use of different technology stacks for each service, meaning that developers can choose the best technology for each service.

> Better resiliency - Microservices helps applications withstand failures, maintain availability, and enhance performance in distributed systems.

> Increased scalability - Microservices helps empowers teams to choose the best tools fow specific tasks, leverage existing expertise, and adopt new technologies without disrupting the entire system.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
Similarities:
> SOA and Microservices can withstand failures as SOA can be reusable and Microservices has the resiliency to withstand the possible failures.

> SOA and Microservices are still maturing because of the growth of internet

> SOA and Microservices can both allow development teams to build, deploy, and manage modern applications efficiently for cloud environment


Differences:
>SOA is base on sharing components while microservices is based on the concept of bounded context.

>SOA services are shared and reused while microservice is built on individuals services.

>SOA is for group of services while microservices focus on single-purpose services.
